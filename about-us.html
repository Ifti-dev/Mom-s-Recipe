                    Moms recipe is a platform where moms can upload their recipe, so that other people can follow it and cook their own. So what are you waiting for? Sign up today! 
                    Mom’s Recipe is a web-based platform designed to help users share, preserve, and follow
homemade recipes — especially those created by our mothers. The project aims to bridge
the emotional and practical gap experienced when living away from family, allowing users to
cook their mother’s recipes and recreate the warmth of home-cooked food.
This website enables users to register, log in, upload recipes with images and details, and
manage them through a personalized dashboard. Visitors can explore recipes, view
ingredients and instructions, and even mark their favorite dishes. The system is built using
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with browser local storage serving as the data storage solution.
Through this project, I demonstrate the complete implementation of CRUD functionalities
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) without a backend server, offering a simple, user-friendly,
and emotional way to share the taste of love and tradition online.
